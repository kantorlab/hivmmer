[0.1.3]
* Added an output file listing the frequency of specific insertion codons at
  each site (issue-1).
* Replaced the fastx_collapser stage with a new QC filtering stage that
  implements a read length filter (>75) and mean PHRED score filter (>25), and
  performs deduplication like fastx_collapser (issue-6).
